As a language model AI, I am unable to create visual designs directly; however, I can provide you with a detailed description of a new design concept for the VirtueMaster app using best practices for React Native user interface design. 

1. Responsive Style Properties:
Ensure that the VirtueMaster app UI scales seamlessly across different screen sizes and resolutions by using a combination of flexboxes, relative units (such as percentages), and media queries.

2. Compact Design System:
Create a design system that focuses on three core aspects - spacing, color, and typography.

    a. Spacing: Establish a consistent spacing scale with values such as 4, 8, 16, and 32 for padding and margins. Use these values to maintain a consistent visual hierarchy and balance throughout the app.

    b. Color: Develop a color palette for the VirtueMaster app that includes primary, secondary, and accent colors, along with a range of neutral colors for backgrounds, text, and borders. Ensure that the palette adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0) for sufficient color contrast ratios.

    c. Typography: Choose a clean, legible typeface for the app that works well on both Android and iOS platforms. Define text styles for headings, subheadings, body text, and captions, with appropriate font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing.

3. Platform-Centric Design:
Adapt the user interface to offer platform-specific experiences that consider design patterns and conventions of iOS and Android.

    a. Navigation: Implement platform-specific patterns for navigation, such as using a bottom tab bar for iPhone and a navigation drawer for Android.

    b. Components and transitions: Utilize platform-specific UI components and animations where possible, ensuring a native experience for users.

4. Improved Layout for VirtueMaster App:

    a. Home Screen: Display a dashboard containing relevant information, such as the user's progress in cultivating virtues, daily tasks, and recent achievements.

    b. Virtues: Provide a dedicated screen for viewing and managing virtues, listing them in a grid or table format with concise descriptions and progress indicators.

    c. Tasks and Activities: Offer a calendar view for scheduling and tracking tasks or activities that help cultivate virtues. Allow users to easily set reminders and view their task history.

    d. Achievements: Showcase a screen where users can view their earned badges or rewards for completed tasks, milestones reached, or other app-related accomplishments.

    e. Settings and Profile: Allow users to access their account settings and personal information from the main navigation. Include options to customize their experience, such as choosing a preferred color scheme or notification preferences.

By following these best practices for React Native user interface design, the improved VirtueMaster app will offer a cohesive, intuitive, and enjoyable user experience across different platforms and devices.
