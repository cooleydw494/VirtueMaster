// Task 17: Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables and functions
// Consider adopting and enforcing consistent naming conventions across the entire codebase. Some best practices include:
// 1. Using camelCase for variable names and object properties.
// 2. Using PascalCase for class and component names.
// 3. Using UPPER_CASE for constants.
// 4. Providing descriptive names for variables and functions that indicate their purpose and functionality.
// 5. Following established naming guidelines in the React Native community and within your team.
// Implement these naming conventions consistently throughout the entire codebase, not only in this file.
