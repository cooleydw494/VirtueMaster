// Task 17: Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables and functions
// Consider adopting and enforcing consistent naming conventions across the entire codebase. Some best practices include:
// 1. Using camelCase for variable names and object properties.
// 2. Using PascalCase for class and component names.
// 3. Using UPPER_CASE for constants.
// 4. Providing descriptive names for variables and functions that indicate their purpose and functionality.
// 5. Following established naming guidelines in the React Native community and within your team.
// Implement these naming conventions consistently throughout the entire codebase, not only in this file.

/* CodeMonkey Comments:

- GoalsScreen.js is the screen component handling goals and virtue-related challenges for users.
- It renders a container with a title and a placeholder text for future implementations of goals display and interactivity.

Suggestions for improving this file:

1. Implement a more robust and interactive goals system where users can add, edit, and keep track of their progress.
2. Use custom components for list items and other views to improve usability and user experience.
3. Optimize and follow recommended React Native best practices, such as conditionally rendering only the visible goals on the screen.
