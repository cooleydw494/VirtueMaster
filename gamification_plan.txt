Gamification Feature Implementation Plan:

1. Update the database schema to store points and rewards:
  - Add a points and rewards table to the schema.
  - Modify the existing user table to include points and rewards-related fields, if needed.

2. Modify existing tables or create new ones, if necessary:
  - Consider the user_virtues and daily_virtue_entries tables for possible points and rewards-related modifications.

3. Implement logic to calculate points and rewards:
  - Determine the rules for earning points and rewards (e.g., based on progress, consistency, login streaks, etc.).
  - Implement points calculation logic in relevant parts of the app, such as when progress is tracked or milestones are achieved.

4. Display points and rewards in the app:
  - Show users their current points and rewards on the Home Screen, Progress Screen or a dedicated Rewards Screen.
  - Incorporate a leaderboard or other social elements to motivate users and foster healthy competition.
